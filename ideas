These are ideas I hope to implement in the future. However the priority now is to finish the campaign so I'm writing them down here so I don't forget

Scenario 2
Create death move for the elite guard (one attacks everyone around him, the other kills an adjacent non-critical level 1 unit)
Make the assassin extra good against the elite guard (killing them without triggering the death move?)
Have extra dialogue between the Orc Leader and the Kthanti if they attack each other


Units
Swamp Lord: Make the terrain he is in as well as the four adjacent ones (u,d,l,r) become swamp. When he moves away they revert to normal form.
Soothsayer Level 3: Has a Miasma around him. Don't know what it'll do yet
